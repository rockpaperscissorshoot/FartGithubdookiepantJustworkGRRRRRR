            <h4 id="signalisDeveloper">Developer: rose-engine</h4>
            <p id="signalisParagraph">A phenomenal survival horror game following the journey of ELSTER as you navigate her through a tragic scene looking for a lost loved one.<br> It utilizes a very pixelated graphic style to further immerse you into its story.</p>

    <div id="signalisMoreInfo" class="infoSection slide" data-parallax>
        <p id="signalismoreInfo">Signalis' story keeps you trapped in an endless cycle of asking 'why' but never gives you an answer. It makes you keep moving forward with barely a sliver of a motive that you make ELSTER hold onto. It asks you who you are, gives you an answer then rips it away again with another question. The hopelessness emulated by the setting of a zombie infested mineshaft further adds to this. Signalis confuses you, makes you go through loops of questions and preys on your mind. If you enjoy a good psychological and survival horror, this game is highly recommended and is available on Steam. </p>
